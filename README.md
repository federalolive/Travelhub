# TRIPLYNX

TRIPLYNX is an app built for users who want an interactive platform to write, post, and share travel logs with their friends and families. It allows for connectivity with others and encourages users to share their experiances of traveling. A map will generate and populate with users logs, as well as showcase and filter friends' logs so you can see where they have gone to.
