# TRIPLYNX

TRIPLYNX is an app built for users who want an interactive platform to write, post, and share travel logs with their friends and families. It allows for connectivity with others and encourages users to share their experiances of traveling. A map will generate and populate with users logs, as well as showcase and filter friends' logs so you can see where they have gone to.

# Planned Future Release
I will be using React in order to create a more responsive front end experiance as having used the API's really made it difficult to style the page. By using React it will also allow me to get closer to my original vision of the app. Users will eventually be able to use the map as the primary hub. 

## Personal Thoughts
This project illicits mixed feelings within me. I spent so much time trying to reach my original vision that my end product suffered drastically. In my efforts to achieve my goal I found myself and my actions coming parrallel to that of Captain Ahab (I left a easter egg reference somewhere in my code, have fun with that.) as I flat out refused to give up trying to get the map to render markers, despite multiple attempts of wiser individuals trying to redirect me to do otherwise. My poor choices however were not without their rewards however. In the process of trying to get the API's to cooperate I gained massive experiance in learning the MVC and CRUD structure whereas before I really struggled with it. I am very grateful for this experiance and look forward to continuing with this growth. I take this lesson also to be aware of my stubburness and to keep in mind that I need to take things in smaller chunks.
